## Top Subgifters by session

This widget shows the top subgifters during the stream. You can choose how many subgifters you want to show and some more customization options.

This widget does not save data. It only uses the data coming from the current stream. 

In case you reload or close and open the overlay, all information will be reset and the top subgifters will start from that moment on.
