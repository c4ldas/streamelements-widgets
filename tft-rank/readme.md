## Preview and instructions

### How to use it:

1 - Put your Summoner Name on `Player Name` field

2 - Select your `region`

3 - Set the amount of time the widget should appear on screen and how long it should be hidden. You can also display it permanently, setting `How long should it be hidden?` value to `0`  

4 - You can also choose whether you want to have the points displayed or not

5 - In Animation, you can select the effect the badge to appear and disappear

6 - In case you want to disable the widget temporarily (let's say you are going to play another game and don't want to display the badge), you can run the command `!rankoff` from your chat. If you want to re-enable it, run `!rankon`. This setting is valid until the widget is reloaded.
