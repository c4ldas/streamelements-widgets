## Windows Activation Prank

This widget emulates an activation Windows screen using Twitch Channel Points. The viewer redeems the Custom Redemption and types a message, which will show in the key field of the activation screen. 

After some seconds, there is a chance (set in the fields) to the activation be successful or trigger a Blue Screen of Death (BSoD). 

It is also possible to set to mute the microphone and desktop audio during the BSoD enabling Websockets on OBS.
