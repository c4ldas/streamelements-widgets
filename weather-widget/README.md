## Weather widget

This widget allows you to add weather information to your Streamelements overlay. It will show your city, temperature, description and current time.

This widget is an import to Streamelements from the original [obs_weather_time_overlay](https://github.com/ngholson/obs_weather_time_overlay) from [ngholson](https://github.com/ngholson/). Please refer to the original overlay as this is just an imported version.
