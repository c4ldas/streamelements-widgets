# Streamelements Custom Widgets
Widgets created by me (or at least the ones I tried to create) for Streamelements overlays.

Those widgets are mainly for Twitch streamers.

## How to install: 

### Option 1 - Click on the link in the description of each widget for 1-click install. 
This will create a new overlay in your Streamelements account.

You can just use the overlay created and add to your OBS, or edit the overlay and duplicate the widget to an overlay you already have
After that, you can remove the overlay that was created when you clicked on the link

### Option 2 - Copy each content to the specific tab on a Custom Widget:
1 - Create a custom widget on Streamelements Overlay Editor (+ icon > Static/Custom > Custom widget)

2 - Click on Open Editor

3 - Replace each tab with the respective content

## Description on how it works

### Each folder will contain 4 files:

_widget.html_

_widget.css_

_widget.js_

_widget.json_


Each file goes directly to the corresponding tab in the custom widget on Streamelements. The only difference is the _widget.json_, which should be copied to FIELDS tab.

## "I changed a lot of things and want to go back to the initial configuration"

In case you want to reset the configuration of the widget to its default, you can go to DATA tab and replace the contents with { }
