## Preview and instructions

### How to use it:

1 - Configure the Font name, size, weight, style and color

2 - Choose the command to reset the counter, like `!resetcounter`. Only the streamer is able to run this command. In case any other user try to run it, it has no effect.

3 - You can choose the multiplier, so for every follower, you can choose how much it is going to be sent to charity

4 - Change the currency symbol, in case you don't want to use `$`

5 - Also choose the decimal separator, the default is period `.`, but in other countries, like Brazil, you can change it to comma `,`
